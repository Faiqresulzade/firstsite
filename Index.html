              <p>If you did more coding than just writing “Hello, world! with a regular font on a big, blank page, chances are that you've come across to these different measurement units: pixels, EMs, REMs and percent.
                 Over the years, much has been debated abou these four units of measurement and when is the best time to use each. Despite the attempts of hundreds of web developers from all over the world to thoroughly 
                 explain the best practices of pixels, EMs, REMs and percent, this topic is still utterly confusing for the simple reason that different projects are completed in different ways, using different measurement units.
                  Before the (now) old trend of responsive web designs emerged, pixels were the default choice for font sizing and everything else: from typography to padding and margin. One pixel dot equals one computer screen dot. 
                  Therefore, these fixed-sized units do not change when opened on a different screen, because they're not scalable. Although it is not impossible to build a responsive website using pixels, sorting all those pixel values in your CSS can get pretty messy.
                 But you can save yourself from trouble by simply using other, scalable measurement units, such as EM and REM.</p>

                   <p>The percent unit is quite similar to the EM unit, because it is always relative to another value.
                     However, they still have fundamental differences. This unit is also used in responsive web designs
                      and web document texts as well, as it is fully scalable and flexible.
